## Narrative - Sprint 2 Summary
We started our sprint on Monday (11/4) with a planning meeting where we decided to focus our efforts this week on front-end development. As a team we created user stories and acceptance criteria based on the project requirements and scored each story - poker-style - using  Fibonacci sequencing.

We completed the following stories:
1. Developed the about page 
2. Developed static event details and new events pages
3. Developed headers and footers across for all web pages
4. Created links to each page

We were able to complete all of our user stories as planned for this sprint and Daniel already started dynamic routing for the event details page which he will continue into Sprint 3. More importantly, the team followed development best practices and reviewed each other's work before merging into the master (see below).

## Narrative - Sprint 3 Preview
For Sprint 3, we will focus on back end development and standing up web site anaytics. After next week, we should be prepared to start observing how customers (bots) interact with our page when traffic hits the site. To improve our team's productivity, we have blocked off "peer programming" time - two hour weekly development sessions that our team can use to collectively solve problems and share best practices.
